# Hospital-Managment
## Abstract
The project we have done is about HOSPITAL MANAGMENT SYSTEM and this includes managing the doctor’s details, patient’s details, and booking appointments etc. Doctor’s details include their IDs, departments which they belong, name etc. Patient details include ID, name, department, gender, age etc. Each doctor in the hospital and patients will have unique ID, so whenever if we want to access details of a particular doctor or a patient the full details of them can be seen 
by just entering the ID. 
Using this HOSPITAL MANAGEMNT SYSTEM it’s also possible to book 
appointments for a particular doctor whom patient wants. Patient can know the 
availability of the doctor of a particular department using doctor ID. Then patient can 
enter the appointment session time they required, so then the appointment will be 
booked. One can even have a choice of editing the appointment which he/she has booked if he wants to change his appointment session time by selecting the option 'edit appointment'.
If one can want to cancel the appointment which he has booked he can select the option called cancel an appointment and give his ID then his appointment will get canceled
We can access this HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM through two modes admin mode and user mode.
User mode will have access for only viewing the details of doctors or patients, by using admin mode only we one can manage doctors and patients details or book an appointment.
This HOSPITAL MANAGEMNT SYSTMEM will import a file write file. It’s because of this file only we can we can manage the data of a patient and doctor Whenever we 
have entered the details these will get stored in excel files. So, if we want to know the details of a patient or a doctor this System will import these files and print our required data using the file called Read file.

## Introduction
The purpose of creating this is to simplify the process of hospital management and 
make things easily accessible. A full-fledged software can fulfil the requirements for 
the daily use in a hospital, their data can be stored and viewed easily.
The workspace and work required can also be reduced. This hospital management 
system will allow to you to add, modify or edit, search and delete the data. 
The concepts of functions, file and data structure is often used in this process. This can 
be used by any person who has a basic knowledge in computers.
The long stalling registers can be eliminated by using this system. This is a most 
commonly used program in any hospital or hotel registration system etc.
In case of emergencies these help us to access the information about the patient easily 
and contact details, so we can skip all the searching in the book make it easy for the 
workers. This makes the connectivity between the hospital and the patient easy

###  Overview of regular HMS
In this project we will store all the details of the patients and doctors. The doctors who 
are treating the patient with the info of the patient. They can be used by and can be 
displayed in this code. 
This code allows us to change, delete or modify data that is stored. An effective 
Hospital Management System will be based on the standard operating procedures 
and best practices, leaving little or no room for error.
The HMS enables your health facility to care for its patients better through faster 
processes, storing and analysis of patient history, preparation and access of real time 
reports, appointment scheduling and tracking, and many more such processes. 
Employees, too, find it easier to manage the huge numbers of patients, records, and 
other jobs critical to the smooth functioning of a healthcare facility

## Methodology
This is just the code work of the hospital management system without any user 
interference. We wrote this code in python language which is a object-oriented, highlevel programming language. 
Even though we didn’t use any classes we used exception handling to handle the 
errors that pop when there is an error. 
For doing this project with UI we must have a pre requisite knowledge about SQL or 
CSS and html.
The prerequisites for this project are basic understanding in python concepts such as 
files concept, exception handlings and loops.
Iterative Loops are the most used methodology in this project.

### Process of importing files in main code
We first have an admin password, which allows us to take add, change or delete any 
data. And there is user mode which allows us to only see the data. We can only 
change data in admin mode. In this program we import 2 data files which are have 
data of doctors and patients.
If we go into the admin mode we can write and edit the data files that are imported.
Loop are used to cross verify every input of the user and then work on basic of their 
inputs. Based on the user requirements the user gives his input and the code works 
accordingly.
We display the number of choices available and the option that the user has to give 
in order to do that, if a user enters wrong data or input, we are using exception 
handling concept to prevent any error message and continue the code until the end.

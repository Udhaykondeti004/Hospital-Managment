# Hospital-Managment
### Abstract
The project we have done is about HOSPITAL MANAGMENT SYSTEM and this includes managing the doctor’s details, patient’s details, and booking appointments etc. Doctor’s details include their IDs, departments which they belong, name etc. Patient details include ID, name, department, gender, age etc. Each doctor in the hospital and patients will have unique ID, so whenever if we want to access details of a particular doctor or a patient the full details of them can be seen 
by just entering the ID. 
Using this HOSPITAL MANAGEMNT SYSTEM it’s also possible to book 
appointments for a particular doctor whom patient wants. Patient can know the 
availability of the doctor of a particular department using doctor ID. Then patient can 
enter the appointment session time they required, so then the appointment will be 
booked. One can even have a choice of editing the appointment which he/she has booked if he wants to change his appointment session time by selecting the option 'edit appointment'.
If one can want to cancel the appointment which he has booked he can select the option called cancel an appointment and give his ID then his appointment will get canceled
We can access this HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM through two modes admin mode and user mode.
User mode will have access for only viewing the details of doctors or patients, by using admin mode only we one can manage doctors and patients details or book an appointment.
This HOSPITAL MANAGEMNT SYSTMEM will import a file write file. It’s because of this file only we can we can manage the data of a patient and doctor Whenever we 
have entered the details these will get stored in excel files. So, if we want to know the details of a patient or a doctor this System will import these files and print our required data using the file called Read file.
